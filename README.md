Current Goals:

I have some initial text output from visual 3d and I'm seeking to organize a workflow that will allow me to pull granular gait data into "Python world" where it can be summarized for statistical analysis in R. 

The next step now is to get a single data file with basic belt speed data between gait events and import it. I believe this data is not yet in a preferred format because it really needs to have all data in a given file represent time series data between events. 
In a way, I don't really even need to tag the "start_adapt" and "end_adapt" instances. I should be able to see that within the footfall data. This may also provide a place for flagging individual steps as "bad".
