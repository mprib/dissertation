To facilitate drafting of my dissertation amid my waning enthusiasm, I'm going to figure out a way to do it in plain text and somehow integrate with my advisor.
I suspect that there may be some additional steps to knit to a word document that Hao or the committee can then make comments on, and then I will need to integrate those comments back into the raw text.
While this will present a challenge, it's something that I'm willing to attempt if only to have the simplicity of working in plain text and perhaps integrating with LLMs in VSCode.
