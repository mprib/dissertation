# Aim 2
Note that "Aim 2" refers to what I plan for my main dissertation and not comps

## Hypothesis: SLR moves significantly in same direction in all conditions

Planned comparisons are made between baseline and post adaptation within each condition. 
Powered to distinguish differences in interaction effect (i.e. PDSV may have half impact on SLR)
```{r}

  "cSBT" = 1,

## Hypothesis: PF impulse increases in FastProp, decreases in other conditions

Planned comparisons are made between baseline and post adaptation within each condition. 
Powered to distinguish differences in interaction effect (i.e. PDSV may have half impact on SLR)

post_means <-list(
  "cSBT" = .299,
  "FastProp" = .463, 
  "FastBrake" = .326
)

# estimates based on Allen et al (2011)
